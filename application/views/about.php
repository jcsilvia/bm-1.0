                Bullet-Monkey.com started out as an idea to help shooting enthusiasts find fairly priced ammunition locally in the crazy period after the 2012 Presidential Election. Greatly increased demand
                created shortages of common calibers and prices, when ammunition could be found, varied greatly. </p>
            <p>As active participants in the shooting sports community, we came up with the idea to help all of us continue to enjoy shooting. Feedback
                from our fellow shooters was enthusiastic and so Bullet-Monkey was born.
